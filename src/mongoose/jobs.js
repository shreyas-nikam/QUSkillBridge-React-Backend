This might involve increasing the amount of data used to train the model, automation of training and prediction, and orchestration of data for continuous prediction. The engineer would be expected to understand the details of the data being used and provide metrics to compare models.\n* Model Enhancement: Work on existing codebases to either enhance model prediction performance or to reduce training time. In this use case you will need to understand the specifics of the algorithm implementation in order to enhance it. This enhancement could be exploratory work based off of a performance need or directed work based off of ideas that other data science team members propose.\n* Machine Learning Tools: The ML Engineer would build a tool for a specific project, or multiple projects though generally these types of projects are decoupled from any one project. The goal of this type of use case would be to ease a pain point in the data science process. This may involve speeding up training, making a data processing easier, or data management tooling.\n\n\n**Qualifications**\n* BS, MS, or PhD degree in Computer Science or related field, or equivalent practical experience.\n* Knowledgeable with Data Science tools and frameworks (i.e. Python, Scikit, NLTK, Numpy, Pandas, TensorFlow, Keras, R, Spark).\n* Basic knowledge of machine learning techniques (i.e. classification, regression, and clustering).\n\n\n How you will lead\n   \n\n  \n\n* Discover data sources, get access to them, import them, clean them up, and make them \u201cmachine learning ready\u201d.\n* Work with data scientists to create and refine features from the underlying data and build pipelines to train and deploy models.\n* Partner with data scientists to understand, implement, refine and design machine learning and other algorithms.\n* Run regular A\/B tests, gather data, perform statistical analysis, draw conclusions on the impact of your models.\n* Work cross functionally with product managers, data scientists and product engineers, and communicate results to peers and leaders.\n* Explore new technology shifts in order to determine how they might connect with the customer benefits we wish to deliver.",

While the problems we solve at SIG are often different from academia, our problems demand the attention of brilliant minds that have an extraordinary attention to detail and a relentless pursuit of understanding.  \n\nThe general lifecycle of a quant project begins with an idea:* This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria.\n* As a Quantitative Researcher, you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming.\n* Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal.\n* You will work side-by-side with technologists in order to backtest your results and put that trading signal into production.\n* Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will continue to do research on that strategy in order to optimize its performance.\n* As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas.\n* Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.\n\n\nWe have a comprehensive orientation program designed to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Education topics include an introduction to options pricing, exposure to our proprietary data sets, and opportunities to practice data analysis techniques. Beyond orientation, our trading floor serves as an unlimited source of discussion for learning and development. **What we're looking for**  \n\n* PhD in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics\n* Exceptional mathematical problem-solving skills\n* Strong communication skills in a fast-paced and\/or highly collaborative environment are essential\n* Strong, practical computing skills; a specific language proficiency is less important than your ability to get computers to accomplish tasks efficiently and reliably\n* Experience working on in-depth research projects\n* Finance experience is not a requirement\n\n  \n\nBy applying to this role, you will be automatically considered for the Quantitative Systematic Trader position. There is no need to apply to both positions in order to be considered for both.  \n\nVisa sponsorship is available for this position.  \n\nThe annual base pay range for this role is $200,000 - $225,000 + discretionary bonus + benefits. SIG considers factors such as scope and responsibilities of the position, work experience, education\/training, key skills, as well as market and organizational considerations when extending an offer.  \n\nSIG does not accept unsolicited resumes from recruiters or search firms. Any resume or referral submitted in the absence of a signed agreement will become the property of SIG and no fee will be paid.  \n\nFT24",

        "description": "We\u2019re looking for accomplished researchers who are interested in growing their career in the field of quantitative finance. While the problems we solve at SIG are often different from academia, our problems demand the attention of brilliant minds that have an extraordinary attention to detail and a relentless pursuit of understanding.  \n\nThe general lifecycle of a quant project begins with an idea:* This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria.\n* As a Quantitative Researcher, you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming.\n* Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal.\n* You will work side-by-side with technologists in order to backtest your results and put that trading signal into production.\n* Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will continue to do research on that strategy in order to optimize its performance.\n* As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas.\n* Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.\n\n\nWe have a comprehensive orientation program designed to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Education topics include an introduction to options pricing, exposure to our proprietary data sets, and opportunities to practice data analysis techniques. Beyond orientation, our trading floor serves as an unlimited source of discussion for learning and development. **What we're looking for**  \n\n* Master's degree in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics\n* Exceptional mathematical problem-solving skills\n* Strong communication skills in a fast-paced and\/or highly collaborative environment are essential\n* Strong, practical computing skills; a specific language proficiency is less important than your ability to get computers to accomplish tasks efficiently and reliably\n* Experience working on in-depth research projects\n* Finance experience is not a requirement\n\n  \n\nBy applying to this role, you will be automatically considered for the Quantitative Systematic Trader position. There is no need to apply to both positions in order to be considered for both.  \n\nVisa sponsorship is available for this position.  \n\nThe annual base pay range for this role is $200,000 - $225,000 + discretionary bonus + benefits. SIG considers factors such as scope and responsibilities of the position, work experience, education\/training, key skills, as well as market and organizational considerations when extending an offer.  \n\nSIG does not accept unsolicited resumes from recruiters or search firms. Any resume or referral submitted in the absence of a signed agreement will become the property of SIG and no fee will be paid.  \n\nFT24",
